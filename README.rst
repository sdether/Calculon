Installation
============
Currently using the driver in the GAC is not supported.  Simply copy the driver assembly somewhere and reference it in your project.  It should be deployed in your application's bin directory.  It is not necessary to reference the test assemblies.

Dependencies

Patches
=======
Patches are welcome and will likely be accepted.  By submitting a patch you assign the copyright to me, Arne F. Claassen.  This is necessary to simplify the number of copyright holders should it become necessary that the copyright need to be re-assigned or the code re-licensed.  The code will always be available under an OSI approved license.
